## Your Summary of Content of Paper

## Quality of research 
### Is the research question or objective clearly stated?
The research objective is mostly clear, but with a slight tension between the title and the abstract. Whilst the title can give the impression that the focus is primarily about sport, the abstract (and then the paper itself) are about using "sports teams as archetypal contexts to inform management research". The abstract gives a clear distinction of the two archetypes and the objectives.
### Is the research question interesting and important?
understanding why knowledge management is important to an organisation is a prerequisite for enabling value from knowledge management. According to multiple sources, such as this white paper from D2L software 
> (Modern learning is a team sport - https://www.hci.org/system/files/2019-12/Organizational-Alignment-Playbook-D2L-OPTIMIZED.pdf) 
"Achieving alignment around a modern learning strategy is key for creating a modern learning culture within your organisation", and so research that align organisational structure and knowledge management techniques is important.
### Is the work original?
This work is original and primary research. The mechanism of differentially studying two different sports organisations and proposing that the organisational structures are directly related to the type of knowledge stands in contrast to other papers in the field - see 
> "Presentation of a Suitable Model for Knowledge
> Management Establishment in Sport Organizations:
> Delphi Classic Method
> 1Mohammad Ebrahim Razaghi
> ,
> 2 Seyed Jafar Moosavi,

> Annals of Applied Sport Science, vol. 1, no. 2, pp. 33-41, Summer 2013
> http://aassjournal.com/article-1-42-en.pdf
", which, whilst giving an insightful and deep dive into a model for knowledge management, only gives a single model as opposed to differentiating.
Many of the other knowledge management papers in the area focus on knowledge transfer in organisational management rather than specific to sports - see

which focuses on the management of sports events; or one of the various papers on the knowledgement management within the Olympic games..

### Is the background research clear and relevant?
The background research is wide ranging and sets the scope for the paper. Starting with a field review in 
 >Witherspoon, CL, J Bergner C Cockrell and DN Stone (2013). Antecedents of organizational
> knowledge sharing: A meta-analysis and critique. Journal of Knowledge Management,
> 17(2), 250–277.
and then exploring various arenas across the knowledge managemenmt space, including managerial architectures, the theory of organisation theory as it applies to Sports Organisations, and more research into general knowledge management

The paper explored, and highlighted how it departs from 
> Argote, L, B McEvily and R Reagans (2003). Managing knowledge in organisations:
> An integrative framework and review of emerging themes. Management Science, 49(4),
> 571–582.
> https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aeb2/3992f2a2d386a3a3521908c5354905fc3352.pdf
but also expanded on some of the work from this paper (i.e. Figure 1, Theoretical framework for Organizing research) by exploring how knowledge management dimensions and sub dimensions can map to organisational structures.
The background research seems clear and relevant; and indeed is a necessary precursor to understanding much of the papers original research.

### Are there any ethical problems?
No ethical problems were identified

## The Research Method
### Summarise the research method
The research method started with a mix of interviews with players and coaches, and recorded or transcribed team meetings, practices and games. The data collected is then encoded, firstly by following Argote, L, B McEvily and R Reagans (2003) 
and then by following 
> Eisenhardt, KM (1989). Building theories from case study research, The Academy of Management Review, 14(4), 532–550.
> https://journals.aom.org/doi/full/10.5465/amr.1989.4308385
which provides "a roadmap for building theories from case study research" [Eisenhardt, KM (1989), p 532], and then a coding of the transcriptions. As no tools are mentioned, and the phrases "The first author conducted the open coding step" and "!This was a highly iterative process" were both used
### Does the research method seem appropriate for the research question?
The research method is appropriate as it moves qualitative data to a more analytic format.
For instance, where the paper says that they "used the new data from follow-up interviews to decide whether to retain, revise, or discard the inferences.", this follows an accepted approach from the chosen methodology 
They also follow other recommendations from this and other case study framework papers, such as giving "individuals on the team unique roles"[Eisenhardt, KM (1989), p 538] 
### Are the methods adequately described? 
The methods are named, and the references to the methods are listed - cross-case pattern matching [Eisenhardt, KM (1989), p 540] . In addition, validation of the appropriateness of the methods is provided.
### Were the analyses done correctly? 
This is not possible to ascertain - the methods are provided, but the raw data (transcripts and notes) is not provided, and neither are any of the intermediate steps or the manual coding and categorisations. The propositions and conclusions are plausible, but an analysis can't be reproduced without redo-ing primary research
### Are the conclusions supported by the data?
Insofar as the data provided indicates, the conclusions are a logical extension of the item listed - but the supporting data are only anecdotal rather than rigorous. One interview from each team rather than summary tables of case patterns.

## Quality of Presentation
### Is the work well presented?
The work is well presented, and at first read appears excellent until the deeper data issues are dug into
### Is the paper well structured?
The paper is structured in a logical format, numbered and builds to it's conclusions well.
### Are symbols, terms, and concepts adequately defined?
Yes - for instance, synonyms are used to disambiguate where needed - for instance, "organisational structures including bureaucratic, networked and market-based
(matrix, collaborative and virtual" 
### Would additional tables, figures help to clarify the work?
The tables chosen at the level of detail are useful, but tables of the cross-case pattern matching as well as, for figure 2, showing which patterns comprised categories which were then rolled up into the shown sub-dimensions would have made the research conclusions be more reproducible
	
## Additional Notes
This research paper is a deep and insightful work on the comparative structures within knowledgement, and the detailing of the archetypes is good - but it has a deep and structural flaw in that it sticks entirely to the structure of the organisation but does not talk to the mechanisms and structures of how the knowledge tranfer occurs.
Without reference to technology, understanding the type of knowledge transfer - be it verbal, led by example, literal book knowledge (for instance a library owned by a sports team, that could include both published books and internally produced writings), tools such as Coaches Eye (https://www.coachseye.com/), written training programs, drills, email systems, instant messaging and indeed even a formal knowledge management system. The structure of knowledge is not distinct from the structure of media, and this paper would have done well to include data on the media knowledge is contained in.

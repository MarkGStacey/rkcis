## Your Summary of Content of Paper

## Quality of research 
### Is the research question or objective clearly stated?
The research objective is mostly clear, but with a slight tension between the title and the abstract. Whilst the title can give the impression that the focus is primarily about sport, the abstract (and then the paper itself) are about using "sports teams as archetypal contexts to inform management research". The abstract gives a clear distinction of two archetypes 
### Is the research question interesting and important?
Understanding why knowledge management is important to an organisation is a prerequisite for enabling value from knowledge management. According to multiple sources, such as this white paper from D2L software (Modern learning is a team sport), "Achieving alignment around a modern learning strategy is key for creating a modern learning culture within your organisation", and so research that align organisational structure and knowledge management techniques is important.
### Is the work original?
This work is original and primary research. The mechanism of differentially studying two different sports organisations and proposing that the organisational structures are directly related to the type of knowledge stands in contrast to other papers in the field - see 
> "Presentation of a Suitable Model for Knowledge
> Management Establishment in Sport Organizations:
> Delphi Classic Method
> 1Mohammad Ebrahim Razaghi
> ,
> 2 Seyed Jafar Moosavi,

> Annals of Applied Sport Science, vol. 1, no. 2, pp. 33-41, Summer 2013
> http://aassjournal.com/article-1-42-en.pdf
", which, whilst giving an insightful and deep dive into a model for knowledge management, only gives a single model as opposed to differentiating.
Many of the other knowledge management papers in the area focus on knowledge transfer in organisational management rather than specific to sports - see

which focuses on the management of sports events; or one of the various papers on the knowledgement management within the Olympic games..

### Is the background research clear and relevant?
The background research is wide ranging and sets the scope for the paper. Starting with a field review in

> 17(2), 250–277.
and then exploring various arenas across the knowledge managemenmt space, including managerial architectures, the theory of organisation theory as it applies to Sports Organisations, and more research into general knowledge management

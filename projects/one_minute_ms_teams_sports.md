## One minute review
Microsoft Teams [(Microsoft Teams 365, 2020) (https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) is a collaboration tool, used for tacit knowledge transfer, and alongside the Sharepoint toolkit forms part of Microsoft's knowledge management software suite.
Saint sports, the University of St Andrews' sports and education department, recently implemented Microsoft teams - the impetus for this was that only 20% of their staff are full time office based, and they needed a central location to access information. Given the date of the publication, this was strikingly good fortune timing wise!
Key challenges that were solved by this initiative included low staff engagement; as well as time wasted looking for documents; and poor understanding of processes.
The highlighted features of Teams includes polls, illustrations, the search functions, and the feature Teams is most famous for - the remote meetings.
This post is very focused on the benefits of Microsoft Teams - the open questions are around any challenges faced during adoption which were overcome, which is not covered. Another open question is how competing products would have fared - are the improvements seen due to the processes changed or the software products utilized?

Collaboration tools can be used by sports teams to enhance training, share knowledge - these will often be common social media platforms such as What's App [(Whatsapp, 2020)](https://www.whatsapp.com/), or facebook groups such as this climbing one [(Facebook, 2020)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/306385676851823). There are however concerns - on security, regulatory or contractual issues, or usability. [(Ahmed, Carmody, Walker, & Admad, 2020)](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/21/bjsports-2019-101707.full) address some of these in a sports medicine context. A platform such as Microsoft Teams, with its fully featured and security compliant platform [(Microsoft, 2020)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/offering-home?view=o365-worldwide) can solve many of these issues - albeit at the cost of a higher administration burden and initial setup. An opportunity for a sports team focused Microsoft partner to step in and build a solution?

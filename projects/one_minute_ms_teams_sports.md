## One minute review
Microsoft Teams is a collaboration tool, used for tacit knowledge transfer, and alongside the Sharepoint toolkit forms part of Microsoft's knowledge management software suite.
Saint sports, the University of St Andrews' sports and education department, recently implemented Microsoft teams - the impetus for this was that only 20% of their staff are full time office based, and they needed a central location to access information. Given the date of the publication, this was strikingly good fortune timing wise!
Key challenges that were solved by this initiative included low staff engagement; as well as time wasted looking for documents; and poor understanding of processes.
The highlighted features of Teams includes polls, illustrations, the search functions, and the feature Teams is most famous for - the remote meetings.
This particular posting is very focused on the benefits of Microsoft Teams - the open questions are around any challenges faced during adoption which were overcome, which is not covered. Another open question is how competing products would have fared - are the improvements seen due to the processes changed or the software products utilized?

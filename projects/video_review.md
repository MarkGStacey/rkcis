My (slightly over) 2 minutes introduction to the Coach Logic application, to tie into the research paper reviewed on the same.
Highlights:
- Simple interface, similar to a facebook feed and familiar, for messaging
- Admin functions are simple and easy to use
- Video analysis and tagging is the heart of the app
- This tagging is easy and straightforward and is key to the success of the app
- The additional collaboration features as spoken about elsewhere are actually only slightly developed and are the biggest opportunity for enhancing the app

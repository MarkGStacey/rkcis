## Your Summary of Content of Paper
This paper differentiates between two different knowledge management (KM) systems, which, whilst unnamed, are described as "geared towards efficiency and routine work, and flexibility and non-routine work", and are suited for organisations which, are respectively "mechanistic" and "organic". While there are competing modes of characterising organisational structure, this paper uses these two - which could be termed "command and control" and "facilitative leadership" - as the two extreme examples of one spectrum of organisational structure.
Two sports teams, American football and ice-hockey have been chosen as exemplarly of the two systems, and the paper uses them as examples of approaches for different organisations. Of note is that neither system is preferred; but the paper explores how different organisational structures suit each of the KM systems. Implicit in the paper itself, is that the mechanistic structure is more suited to a software based KM system, whereas in organic organisations using "empowered experiential learning episodes", traditional KM software tools can be more challenging - and as such knowledge management systems that are useful are more than just "knowledge based systems"  [(Venkitachalam & Busch, 2013)](https://search-proquest-com.salford.idm.oclc.org/docview/939131495?accountid=8058)
The learning processes of the two teams, as established by interviews and observations, are distinct.
The american football team works as if to "a detailed instruction manual", with drills and to an extant knowledge base. This mechanism is an archetype for businesses where employees are "knowledge beneficiaries", such as support or call centers - and in fact many "KM systems" on the market today are sold to these types of businesses. The efficiencies of the american football team come from rote learning and predetermined actions (called "plays") at game time. Successful learning doesn't relate to understanding the entire context.
Ice hockey is presented as the opposite: players are expected to comprehend and react to the entire game, and instead of learning pre-determined actions, a focus is put upon shared "tacit" learnings. One coach was quoted in the  paper as saying "It's more of a system than a game plan." Highlighted also are the limitations of using explicit material - and indeed knowledge based systems to impart learning, and instead coaches need to foster experiential learning opportunities.
The summary of the paper is that the goals of knowledge management are also different in different types of organisations. Mechanistic organisations aim to "maximise efficiency and standardisation", whereas organic organisations aim to "maximise flexibility".
These points are interesting, but it is also good to view the plane of knowledge transfer structures from other researchers - for instance in this research paper on an app [(CoachLogic, 2020)](https://www.coach-logic.com/)
 - [(Vinson, Beeching, Morgan, & Jones)](http://eprints.worc.ac.uk/5305/3/Coach%20Logic%20research%20report%20141016.pdf) is is asserted that it is that "traditional coaching practice is technically focused and so is predominantly concerned with the ‘passing down’ of knowledge from coach to athlete." and that newer coaching processes involve the athlete more. It would be an interesting follow-up study to see how the american football team has changed learnings to verify these assertions and understand how much is inherent to organisational structure as chosen by a coaching team as opposed to structure enforced by the nature of the sport.


## Quality of research 
### Is the research question or objective clearly stated?
The research objective is mostly clear, but with a slight tension between the title and the abstract. Whilst the title can give the impression that the focus is primarily about sport, the abstract (and then the paper itself) are about using "sports teams as archetypal contexts to inform management research". The abstract gives a clear distinction of the two archetypes and the objectives.
### Is the research question interesting and important?
understanding why knowledge management is important to an organisation is a prerequisite for enabling value from knowledge management. According to multiple sources, such as this white paper from D2L software "Modern learning is a team sport" [D2L - desire to learn, n.d.](https://www.hci.org/system/files/2019-12/Organizational-Alignment-Playbook-D2L-OPTIMIZED.pdf
"Achieving alignment around a modern learning strategy is key for creating a modern learning culture within your organisation", and so research that align organisational structure and knowledge management techniques is important.
### Is the work original?
This work is original and primary research. The mechanism of differentially studying two different sports organisations and proposing that the organisational structures are directly related to the type of knowledge stands in contrast to other papers in the field.
[Presentation of a Suitable Model for Knowledge Management Establishment in Sport Organizations: Delphi Classic Method, 2013](http://aassjournal.com/article-1-42-en.pdf), which, whilst giving an insightful and deep dive into a model for knowledge management, only gives a single model as opposed to differentiating.
Many of the other knowledge management papers in the area focus on knowledge transfer in organisational management rather than specific to sports - see 
[(Schenk, Parent, MacDonald, & Therrien, 2015)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16184742.2015.1091022) which focuses on the management of sports events; or one of the various papers on the knowledgement management within the Olympic games:
[(Halbwirth & Toohey)](https://www-tandfonline-com.salford.idm.oclc.org/doi/abs/10.1080/16184740108721890) , [(Frawley & Toohey)](https://www-tandfonline-com.salford.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1080/17430430903053208?src=recsys) 
and indeed one of the books quoted as a reference : [(Slack & Parent, 2006)](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Understanding_Sport_Organizations.html?id=_vzq_SYdMlIC&redir_esc=y)
### Is the background research clear and relevant?
The background research is wide ranging and sets the scope for the paper. Starting with a field review in [(Witherspoon, Bergner, Cockrell, & Stone, 2013)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262860998_Antecedents_of_organizational_knowledge_sharing_A_meta-analysis_and_critique)
and then exploring various arenas across the knowledge management space, including managerial architectures, the theory of organisation theory as it applies to Sports Organisations, and more research into general knowledge management

The paper explored, and highlighted how it departs from [(Argote, McEvily, & Reagans, 2003)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aeb2/3992f2a2d386a3a3521908c5354905fc3352.pdf) but also expanded on some of the work from this paper (i.e. Figure 1, Theoretical framework for Organizing research) by exploring how knowledge management dimensions and sub dimensions can map to organisational structures.
The background research seems clear and relevant; and indeed is a necessary precursor to understanding much of the papers original research.
 This paper also references studies on the tacit-explicit framework, such as [(Venkitachalam & Busch, 2013)](https://search-proquest-com.salford.idm.oclc.org/docview/939131495?accountid=8058), which  distinguishes knowledge management from knowledge-based systems, and is good background reading for understanding the distinguishing factors of the two organisational types.

### Are there any ethical problems?
No ethical problems were identified

## The Research Method
### Summarise the research method
The research method started with a mix of interviews with players and coaches, and recorded or transcribed team meetings, practices and games. The data collected is then encoded, firstly by following Argote, L, B McEvily and R Reagans (2003) 
and then by following 
[(Eisenhardt, 1989)](https://journals.aom.org/doi/full/10.5465/amr.1989.4308385)
which provides "a roadmap for building theories from case study research" (Eisenhardt, KM (1989), p 532), and then a coding of the transcriptions. As no tools are mentioned, and the phrases "The first author conducted the open coding step" and "!This was a highly iterative process" were both used, it is to be assumed that all coding was conducted manually.


### Does the research method seem appropriate for the research question?
The research method is appropriate as it moves qualitative data to a more analytic format.
For instance, where the paper says that they "used the new data from follow-up interviews to decide whether to retain, revise, or discard the inferences.", this follows an accepted approach from the chosen methodology 
They also follow other recommendations from this and other case study framework papers, such as giving "individuals on the team unique roles"[Eisenhardt, KM (1989), p 538] 
### Are the methods adequately described? 
The methods are named, and the references to the methods are listed - cross-case pattern matching [Eisenhardt, KM (1989), p 540] . In addition, validation of the appropriateness of the methods is provided.
### Were the analyses done correctly? 
This is not possible to ascertain - the methods are provided, but the raw data (transcripts and notes) is not provided, and neither are any of the intermediate steps or the manual coding and categorisations. The propositions and conclusions are plausible, but an analysis can't be reproduced without redo-ing primary research, and at least examples of manual coding or categorisation would make it easier to be certain it was done correctly.
### Are the conclusions supported by the data?
Insofar as the data provided indicates, the conclusions are a logical extension of the item listed - but the supporting data are only anecdotal rather than rigorous. One interview from each team rather than summary tables of case patterns.

## Quality of Presentation
### Is the work well presented?
The work is well presented, and at first read appears excellent.
### Is the paper well structured?
The paper is structured in a logical format, numbered and builds to it's conclusions well.
### Are symbols, terms, and concepts adequately defined?
Yes - for instance, synonyms are used to disambiguate where needed - for instance, "organisational structures including bureaucratic, networked and market-based
(matrix, collaborative and virtual" 
### Would additional tables, figures help to clarify the work?
The tables chosen at the level of detail are useful, but tables of the cross-case pattern matching as well as, for figure 2, showing which patterns comprised categories which were then rolled up into the shown sub-dimensions would have made the research conclusions be more reproducible/
	
## Additional Notes
This research paper is a deep and insightful work on the comparative structures within knowledge management, and the detailing of the archetypes is good - but it has a flaw in that it sticks entirely to the structure of the organisation but does not talk to the mechanisms and structures of how the knowledge tranfer occurs. While not core to the stated objective, without reference to technology, understanding the type of knowledge transfer - be it verbal, led by example, literal book knowledge (for instance a library owned by a sports team, that could include both published books and internally produced writings), tools such as Coaches Eye  from [(TechSmith, 2019)](https://www.coachseye.com/), written training programs, drills, email systems, instant messaging and indeed even a formal knowledge management system. The structure of knowledge is not distinct from the structure of media, and this paper would have done well to include data on the media knowledge is contained in. This flaw becomes more apparent as newer work on knowledge management that includes video analysis (which crosses the boundaries between the two archetypes) is reviewed, such as products from (Catapult Sports, 2020).
Another possible view, as reflected in [(Light, Harvey, & Mouchet, 2014)](https://www-tandfonline-com.salford.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1080/13573322.2012.665803) in their reflections on complex learning theory as applied to rugby union football is that the mechanistic approach portrayed here an archetype is instead an older, less effective model for knowledge transfer in sports coaching.

# Review
This paper presents a knowledge based system ("the system") for high performance sports, specifically for Alpine skiers in Germany.
The system was built as a platform using the open source tools TWiki [(TWiki, 2020)](https://twiki.org/), Wordpress  [(Automattic, 2020)](https://wordpress.com/) and OsTube (no longer in use [(Arxive, 2020)](https://www.arvixe.com/ostube_hosting)), as well as various plug ins. The writers of the paper also realised that non software interventions such as curation and categorisation of content, that they called a "Wiki gardener" were necessary for the success of the system.
Seamless integration of the open source tools was done, including single sign on, to aid user adoption by reducing the friction of use.
The system is presented as a success despite self confessed on-going technical limitations as it is still (as at paper publication) still in use by the German Skiing Association.
Key benefits of a software system are presented as including knowledge transfer under conditions of high turnover of users.

The objective of the paper appears to be focused on evangelising the software platform produced with some focus given to presenting the methodologies followed in building the platform.
The primary research conducted was a mix of a user requirements gathering phase that included the unusual strategy of having users write down ideas on a table cloth - which appears to have engaged users who were perhaps more technophobic - and a more traditional iterative software development phase that involves creating prototypes and trialling them with users - the paper concludes, and this researcher agrees, that user inclusion in a design process leads to better adoption even if the software would have been as feature complete and useful without the user involvement. 
The background research referenced focuses mainly on user adoption and a term used frequently in the paper, "the joy of use", and at first glance seem fairly limited when user adoption of knowledge management systems is a fairly widely studied topic - see [(Sherry & Pryubtok, 2001)](https://www-tandfonline-com.salford.idm.oclc.org/doi/abs/10.1080/08874417.2001.11647019) for an example. 
The authors do point out the users and scenarios for KM in high performance sports are atypical, and as this researcher has discovered, academic papers focusing on sports teams are in short supply. (The paper in fact states "untypical", but the authors are clearly not first language english speakers)
The paper's conclusions that non-technical factors and socialisation are more important indicators of a knowledge management system's success than software design or utility is an important one - for sports organisations and for businesses.
The paper's figures were limited to screenshots of the system itself - diagrams of the integration and architecture of how the systems were put together as well as process diagrams of how users interact with the system would be useful for deeper understanding.

This paper purports to be an unusual example of a knowledge management system built specifically for a sports team - the topic appears to be underserved in comparison to ERP or CRM systems built for sports teams and is worthy of further attention. This is at least partly because the knowledge management field has been somewhat subsumed into the more widely used term "sports analytics" and products in that field encompass the knowledge management practice - and also partly because knowledge management as a practice is broader than a silver bullet technology solution [(Hobert, 2018)](https://blogs.gartner.com/karen-hobert/2018/02/21/no-thing-knowledge-management-market/) - this paper touches on this somewhat, but would have done well to examine the broader role of the practice outside the software implementation. To quote Karen Hobert from Gartner, Knowledge management "cannot be embodied through purely technological or digital means" [(Hobert, 2018)](https://blogs.gartner.com/karen-hobert/2018/02/21/no-thing-knowledge-management-market/)

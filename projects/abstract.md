Knowledge management is a practice that is much broader than just software tools, and indeed has suffered somewhat reputationally with software solutions that are purporting to be a technological panacea without the cultural change to truly reap the benefits
Knowledge management in sport, and more specifically knowledge management for the sports team's onfield performance, the theme tying these reviews together thus spans the practice as a whole: from the behaviours and structures of the teams who are implementing knowledge management 
- In the form of research into organisational structures and how that affects knowledge based systems
- An (older) paper examining a software tool built specifically as a knowledge management system (KMS)
- More modern tools that encompass explicit knowledge sharing, collaboration elements to facilitate tacit knowledge transfer, and video analysis to enhance experiential learning

A key point through the research theme is that processes and tools that encompass knowledge management are often embedded in other systems - such as sports analytics or video coaching systems - or other tools that enable knowledge management are merely a part. Examples include such collaboration tools as  (Microsoft Teams, What's App or Facebook groups are all widley used examples, as discussed). 
Knowledge can be broadly split into explicit or codified knowledge and tacit knowledge. Knowledge management as a discipline can be split into mechanistic and organic. These axes do somewhat align, and in organisations that are strictly mechanistic, knowledge that is transferred is often codified and the knowledge based systems implemented in these organisations will often reflect this. Certain sports such as American Football have tended to work more mechanistically, as discussed in "Knowledge Management Systems in Sports:The Role of Organisational Structure, Tacit and Explicit Knowledge" - but the evolution of coaching in sports is moving forward from mechanistic structures and one way knowledge transfer, and the use of modern software tools blend explicit knowledge transfer, collaborative tools to assist with tacit knowledge transfer, and the use of sensors and video to enhance performance analysis and experiential learning.

A paper from an older, pure knowledge based system is presented for it's views on structure of codified information and an early attempt at building a collaborative KMS
Literature from two of these modern toolsets are covered:
- Coach-Logic, which is more aimed at amateur teams and includes video analyis and collaboration tools
- Catapult, which is aimed at professional teams and correlates sensor based data capture with video analysis and athlete management systems

A key point identified in the Coach-Logic paper was the need for further research and development of integration with strength and conditioning coaches as well as physiotherapists.

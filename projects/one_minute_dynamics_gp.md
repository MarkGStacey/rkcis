This video is a marketing driven video, for an early version of Great Plains (now Microsoft Dynamics GP) software from 2003.
A windows based software product, let alone cloud or even web does date the application somewhat.
The focus on some core details - blanket POs, product allocations, integrated financial reporting - do show that this 8.0 version is a big step up from the previous one - but an interesting research point would be to chart how these features would be considered basic (or "table stakes" to use a colloquialism) in todays modern ERP systems such as the spiritual successor, Dynamics 365

A relative emphasis on how ERP systems enable smaller businesses to grow - and while the software space has evolved, this will be true of many businesses who haven't started with an ERP (or a smaller one that doesn't scale)

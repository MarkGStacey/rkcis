### FOR PRACTICE ONLY

This video is about the Toledo Mud hens, who are in the Top 10 of 160 Minor League baseball teams in terms of attendance.
Microsoft Dynamics CRM and GP was used to automate mail campaigns, especially around following up on season tickets.
One salesman speaking went from 6 to 8 hours a day manually entering invoices down to 1/2 hour a day.
Interestingly, the screen grab showing a mail campaign is labelled Exact Target (now owned by [Salesforce](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2013/06/04/salesforce-to-buy-exacttarget-for-2-5-billion/) ), a separate mail campaign piece of software not mentioned explicitely in the video, but apparently integrated and being used for the targetted mailing campaigns.
Microsoft CRM saves the Mud hens an estimated 2000 hours annually by automating sales and supply chain processes.

This paper looks into the use of video analysis to assist in knowledge transfer between coaches and athletes, focusing specifically on one software application, Coach Logic [(CoachLogic, 2020)](https://www.coach-logic.com/)
CoachLogic is a tool that comprises video analysis and supplemental materiel "such as training plans, playbooks etc", as well as tagging and comments - in short a knowledge based system rather than just video analysis. Coach logic is a subscription based service.
Seven head coaches, their assistants and a sample of players were interviewed.

The usage of the app fell into 3 areas
- Player input for performance analysis
- Collaborative performance analysis
- Pair learning with senior and junior players

This form of learning falls more into the tacit type of knowledge as described in [(Venkitachalam & Busch, 2013)](https://search-proquest-com.salford.idm.oclc.org/docview/939131495?accountid=8058) than encoded learning, as well as being experiential and shared. 
Through the series of interviews with the coaches and players, the role of the coach was established as:
- Engage the athlete
- Athletes to actively analyse their own performance as well as their role in the broader context
- Coaches to support the players when they don't yet know what they're looking for in the video being shared. 
  
The use of a software tool in this context allows the players to engage at length and asynchronously and not just through a post-match review in person, "demanding an immediate response". This process also enables player to player collaboration and pair learning. As covered in [Erhardt & Martin-Rios, Vol. 15, No. 02, 1650023 (2016)](https://www-worldscientific-com.salford.idm.oclc.org/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219649216500234) and their coverage of the "organic" coaching organisation, where experiential learning is highlighted as the most important facet.
Additional features of the software include creating "rooms" - general or position specific - which are used to do collaborative analysis of either match performance or enhance training. This and other  features are especially useful in amateur teams where coaches and athletes are time-poor. Indeed, Coach-Logic seems to be more aimed at amateur teams than other products such as [(Stratus Sports, 2020)](http://stratussports.com/Features/Data) etc.
The paper concludes that, despite not having analysed objective measures of success, the players and coaches of the seven clubs all use the system extensively, and indeed themselves credit the use of the system with impressive improvements in performance. 
This review of the effectiveness of video based analysis (specifically coach-player collaborative video analysis as opposed to motion analysis) is a good review of the effectiveness of these tools; but also highlights the ways in which the knowledge transfer process needs to be designed to not just be a one way process from coach to player. 
One aspect that this paper doesn't cover is whether the application includes a prebuilt knowledge base of videos and other material, as some competitors do [(Stratus Sports, 2020)](http://stratussports.com/Features/Data)
The paper finishes with a good call to action in suggesting further research and development to integrate coaching platforms with strength and conditioning coaches and physiotherapists.

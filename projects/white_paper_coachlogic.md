This paper looks into the use of video analysis to assist in knowledge transfer between coaches and athletes, focusing specifically on one software application, Coach Logic [(CoachLogic, 2020)](https://www.coach-logic.com/)
CoachLogic is a tool that comprises video analysis and supplemental materiel "such as training plans, playbooks etc", as well as tagging and comments - in short a knowledge based system rather than just video analysis. 
Seven head coaches, their assistants and a sample of players were interviewed.

The usage of the app fell into 3 areas
- Player input for performance analysis
- Collaborative performance analysis
- Pair learning with senior and junior players

This form of learning falls more into the tacit type of knowledge as described in [(Venkitachalam & Busch, 2013)](https://search-proquest-com.salford.idm.oclc.org/docview/939131495?accountid=8058) than encoded learning, as well as being experiential and shared.

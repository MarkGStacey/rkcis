Catapult [(Catapult Sports, 2020)](https://www.catapultsports.com/) is a leading sports analytics and athlete management system solution provider, and this webinar introduces the third pillar of their solution stack, Catapult video.

Catapult as a company is considered one of the leading sports analytics companies - being integrated with multiple other tools such as Microsoft's Sports Performance Platform - see [(Microsoft, 2017)](https://news.microsoft.com/transform/seattle-seahawks-use-data-and-sports-science-to-help-players-work-as-hard-a [(Catapult Sports, 2020)](t-recovery-as-they-do-on-field/)
[(GeekWire, 2017)](https://news.microsoft.com/transform/seattle-seahawks-use-data-and-sports-science-to-help-players-work-as-hard-at-recovery-as-they-do-on-field/) alongside other leading tools such as FitFor90 [(FitFor90, 2020)](https://www.fitfor90.com/)

Catapult sports has clients across Football, American Football, Australian Rules, Baseball, Basketball, Cricket, Ice Hockey and Rugby [(Catapult Sports, 2020)](https://www.catapultsports.com/sports), and their primary and original business involves wearable devices that monitor players. This webinar covers the latest version of Catapult Video, a software producted developed on the base of a product developed by a company acquired in 2016, XOS [(Sports Business Insider, 2016)](https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2016/07/13/Finance/Catapult.aspx), for $60m

Before introducing the software product, the webinar highlights the manual process currently at play to try analyse video data alongside the physical movement data - it's shown as 7 steps in the webinar - it's worth noting that the later demo does show a more streamlined process, but it's still 3 separate steps to download and import and consolidate between the physical and the video footage.

A nice precis of what "Vision" provides is put in. This is listed as a workflow of:
> capture -> tag -> import -> organise -> telestrate -> present -> share -> communicate in the slide below

Two key potential communication gaps are highlighted:
- Explicit knowledge communication from sports analysts and the strength and conditioning coach to the head coach
- Tacit or experiential knowledge transfer from coaches to players; especially in international sports where language barriers are an increasing challenge

The catapult platform appears, at least in this webinar, to provide useful tooling to bridge both of those gaps. Solving this problem is a challenging one in many cases - as highlighted in general knowledge management research such as [(Erhardt & Martin-Rios, Knowledge Management Systems in Sports: The Role of Organisational Structure, Tacit and Explicit Knowledge, Vol. 15, No. 02, 1650023 (2016))](https://www-worldscientific-com.salford.idm.oclc.org/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219649216500234), different sports such as american football and ice hockey have different knowledge transfer mechanisms, and this is a software product attempting to solve issues in both. The intersection of using video as well as data analytics, and being able to send annotated analysis of videos (with translations if need be) to players' mobile phones is a useful way for coaches to communicate with players.

The webinar, through a thoughtful introduction and well crafted demo, showed how data streams of accelerometer data (covered in Catapult’s white paper, reviewed later (Catapult Sports, n.d.) ) and video analysis can be combined, and then collaborated on between the coach, and the apps on players’ phones – and provided visual aids allows for misunderstandings to be reduced. Compared to the (CoachLogic, 2020) product, this is a much slicker tool, and compared to some other video analysis tools such as Coach’s Eye from (TechSmith, 2019) is clearly more capable. The provision of an existing video library and knowledge base of annotations and insights also clearly gives them an advantage over these other products. Finally, although not covered in the webinar, it is clear that their Athlete Management system (a third product in the suite), and the advanced player load metrics from (Catapult Sports, n.d.) gives them a more complete knowledge management system for coaches and players alike.

The gap in this webinar, and indeed in the Catapult website, and other dependent products, such as Stratus Sports [(Stratus Sports, 2020)](http://stratussports.com/) (which is built on Microsoft's Sport Performance Platform - [(Microsoft In-Culture, 2019)](https://www.microsoft.com/inculture/sports/springboks-rugby/)), as well as searches through journals, is that much of the background researching supporting their results is kept for paying customers. While exceptions such as this white paper [(Catapult Sports)](https://images.catapultsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMA_WP_vF.pdf) exist, the background research appears to be mostly kept as a competitive advantage. The Stratus website explicitely states this, and a competitor product has a high level case study of a winning football season but no academically published research on the topic [(Opta Sports Pro, 2017)](https://www.optasportspro.com/case-study/leicester-city/)

A good follow on research paper would be a comparison of the competitive advantage an integrated solution such as Catapult Sports has against using a combination of Opta Sports and a different hardware vendor such as Sportable [(Sportable, 2020)](https://sportable.com/)
The webinar itself is overall well presented, with good diagrams of functionality and a clear demonstration of the software functionality.
